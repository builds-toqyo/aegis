# Aegis Yield Dynamic Portfolio Vault

A sophisticated DeFi yield optimization platform leveraging AI/ML for dynamic portfolio rebalancing across multiple protocols on Base L2.

##  Architecture Overview

Aegis Yield is built as a monorepo containing three distinct technology stacks:

- **Solidity Smart Contracts** - ERC-4626 vault with upgradeable strategies on Base
- **Go/Rust Backend** - High-performance keeper bot and optimization engine
- **Python ML Engine** - LSTM-based yield prediction and risk modeling

##  Project Structure

```
aegis/
 contracts/          # Solidity smart contracts (Foundry)
 backend/           # Go/Rust keeper bot and API
 ml-engine/         # Python ML models and data pipelines
 scripts/           # Deployment and automation scripts
 test/              # End-to-end integration tests
```

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Foundry** - For Solidity development
- **Go 1.21+** or **Rust 1.75+** - For backend services
- **Python 3.10+** - For ML engine
- **Node.js 18+** - For tooling

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/builds-toqyo/aegis.git
cd aegis

# Install Foundry dependencies
cd contracts && forge install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && go mod download  # or cargo build

# Install ML engine dependencies
cd ml-engine && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development

```bash
# Run Solidity tests
cd contracts && forge test

# Run backend keeper
cd backend && go run keeper-bot/main.go

# Train ML model
cd ml-engine && python scripts/train.py
```

##  Security

- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's audited libraries
- UUPS upgradeable pattern for future improvements
- Multi-signature governance controls
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

##  Key Features

- **ERC-4626 Compliant Vault** - Standard tokenized vault interface
- **Multi-Strategy Architecture** - Aave, Lido, and Delta-neutral strategies
- **AI-Driven Rebalancing** - LSTM predictions for optimal allocation
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Support** - L1 Lido integration via Base bridge
- **Real-Time Risk Management** - Chainlink oracles and custom risk metrics

##  Technology Stack

### Smart Contracts

- Foundry (Forge, Cast, Anvil)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (UUPS, AccessControl, ERC4626)

### Backend
- Go 1.21+ / Rust 1.75+
- Web3 libraries (go-ethereum / ethers-rs)
- REST API (Gin / Axum)

### ML Engine
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
